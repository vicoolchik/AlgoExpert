# AlgoExpert - Sweet and Savory Solution

This code provides a solution to the "Sweet and Savory" problem, where the task is to find the best combination of one sweet dish and one savory dish such that their combined flavor is as close as possible to a given target value without exceeding it. Sweet dishes are represented by negative numbers, while savory dishes are represented by positive numbers.

## `SweetAndSavory`

### Description
The `SweetAndSavory` method takes an array of integers representing dishes, where negative numbers are sweet dishes and positive numbers are savory dishes, and a target value. It returns the pair of one sweet dish and one savory dish whose combined sum is closest to the target without exceeding it.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) - The method involves sorting the sweet and savory dishes separately, which is the most expensive operation.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - Two lists are created to store the sweet and savory dishes, which use space proportional to the input size.

### How It Works

1. **Separate Sweet and Savory Dishes:**
   - The method first iterates through the input array and separates the sweet dishes (negative numbers) from the savory dishes (positive numbers). Two lists, `sweetDishes` and `savoryDishes`, are used to store them separately.

2. **Sort the Lists:**
   - The `sweetDishes` list is sorted based on the absolute values of the dishes, ensuring that the sweet dishes closest to 0 are considered first.
   - The `savoryDishes` list is sorted in ascending order, allowing for efficient pairwise comparison.

3. **Find the Best Pair:**
   - Two pointers, `sweetIndex` and `savoryIndex`, are initialized to point to the first sweet dish and the first savory dish, respectively.
   - The method iterates through the lists, trying to find the pair of one sweet dish and one savory dish whose combined sum is as close as possible to the target without exceeding it.
   - For each pair, the sum of the sweet and savory dish is calculated. If the sum is less than or equal to the target, the difference between the target and the sum is computed. If this difference is smaller than the previously recorded best difference, the pair is updated as the current best pair.

4. **Return the Best Pair:**
   - Once all possible pairs have been considered, the method returns the pair of dishes that best satisfies the condition of being closest to the target without exceeding it.

### Example Walkthrough

Given the input:
- **Dishes:** `[1, 2, -3, 4, 5, -6, 7, -8, 9]`
- **Target:** `3`

**Step 1:** Separate the dishes:
- `sweetDishes = [-3, -6, -8]`
- `savoryDishes = [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9]`

**Step 2:** Sort the dishes:
- `sweetDishes = [-3, -6, -8]` (sorted by absolute value)
- `savoryDishes = [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9]` (already sorted)

**Step 3:** Find the best pair:
- Try `-3 + 1 = -2` (not close to the target).
- Try `-3 + 2 = -1` (closer to the target but still below).
- Continue iterating through pairs until the best pair found is `-3 + 4 = 1`, which is the closest possible sum to the target `3`.

**Result:** The best pair is `[-3, 4]`.

### Pros
- **Efficiency:** The method runs efficiently due to the use of sorting and two-pointer techniques, making it suitable for large inputs.
- **Optimal Solution:** By using sorting and pairwise comparison, the method guarantees the best possible combination of sweet and savory dishes.

### Cons
- **Requires Sorting:** Sorting the lists adds an O(n log n) overhead, which could be less efficient for very small arrays.
- **Assumes Positive Target:** The method assumes the target is positive, and might require adjustment for different ranges of target values.

### Edge Cases
- **No Sweet or Savory Dishes:** If there are no sweet or no savory dishes, the method will not be able to return a valid pair.
- **Exact Target Match:** If a pair of dishes exactly matches the target, it will be identified as the best pair immediately.

## Conclusion

The `SweetAndSavory` method efficiently finds the best combination of one sweet and one savory dish whose combined sum is closest to the target without exceeding it. By using sorting and the two-pointer technique, the solution ensures optimal performance in O(n log n) time, making it a practical solution for real-world scenarios involving large arrays.
