# AlgoExpert - Transpose Matrix Solutions

This code provides two solutions to the problem of transposing a matrix. Transposing a matrix involves flipping it over its diagonal, switching the row and column indices of the matrix. The two methods implemented are `TransposeMatrix` and `TransposeMatrix1`. Below is a detailed description of each approach, including their advantages and disadvantages.

## `TransposeMatrix`

### Description
The `TransposeMatrix` method creates a new matrix where the rows and columns are swapped. For example, the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will be placed at position (j, i) in the transposed matrix. This method returns a new matrix with the transposed values.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n * m) - The algorithm iterates through each element of the original matrix exactly once, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n * m) - The method requires additional space proportional to the size of the original matrix to store the transposed matrix.

### How It Works
1. **Initialize Transposed Matrix:** A new matrix, `transposedMatrix`, is created with dimensions [m, n] where `m` is the number of columns and `n` is the number of rows in the original matrix.
   
2. **Iterate Through Original Matrix:** Two nested loops iterate through the original matrix:
   - The outer loop runs over the rows.
   - The inner loop runs over the columns.
   - Each element from the original matrix is assigned to its transposed position in the new matrix.

3. **Return the Transposed Matrix:** After all elements have been repositioned, the method returns the transposed matrix.

### Pros
- **Clarity:** The method is easy to understand and clearly follows the mathematical definition of matrix transposition.
- **Direct Implementation:** The code directly transposes the matrix in a straightforward manner.

### Cons
- **Additional Space:** The method requires extra space equivalent to the size of the original matrix, which might be a concern for very large matrices.

## `TransposeMatrix1`

### Description
The `TransposeMatrix1` method transposes the matrix in a memory-efficient way by generating the transposed rows one at a time and returning them as an enumerable sequence. Instead of creating a full transposed matrix at once, this method uses `yield return` to produce each row on demand, which can be particularly useful when dealing with large datasets.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n * m) - The method processes each element of the matrix once, similar to `TransposeMatrix`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - The method does not create a new matrix but instead returns each row of the transposed matrix one at a time, thus saving memory.

### How It Works
1. **Iterate Over Columns:** The outer loop iterates over each column of the original matrix.
   
2. **Construct Transposed Rows:** For each column, a new row is created in the transposed matrix by collecting elements from the corresponding column of the original matrix.

3. **Yield Transposed Rows:** Instead of returning a fully constructed matrix, the method yields each transposed row as an `IEnumerable<int[]>`. This allows for more memory-efficient processing, especially useful when the entire transposed matrix is not required at once.

### Pros
- **Memory Efficiency:** The method is highly memory-efficient since it does not require storing the entire transposed matrix in memory at once.
- **Lazy Evaluation:** The use of `yield return` allows for lazy evaluation, making this method ideal for scenarios where only part of the transposed data is needed.

### Cons
- **Complexity in Usage:** The returned `IEnumerable<int[]>` might be less intuitive for those expecting a traditional matrix structure. Users need to be familiar with lazy evaluation and enumeration.

## Conclusion

- **Best for General Use:** The `TransposeMatrix` method is best when a fully transposed matrix is needed, and memory constraints are not a concern. Its straightforward approach makes it easy to implement and understand.
- **Best for Memory Efficiency:** The `TransposeMatrix1` method is ideal for large matrices or scenarios where memory usage is critical. It efficiently generates each row of the transposed matrix on demand, making it suitable for streaming data or when working with very large datasets.

Both methods provide robust solutions to matrix transposition, and the choice between them depends on the specific needs of your application.
