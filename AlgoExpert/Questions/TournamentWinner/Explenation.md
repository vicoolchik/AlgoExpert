# AlgoExpert - Tournament Winner Solution

This code provides a solution to the "Tournament Winner" problem, where the task is to determine which team won the most points in a series of competitions. Each competition involves two teams, and a result list indicates which team won each competition. The winning team is awarded 3 points, and the team with the most points at the end is declared the tournament winner. Below is a detailed description of the implemented solution, including its advantages and disadvantages.

## `TournamentWinner`

### Description
The `TournamentWinner` method determines the overall winner of a tournament by processing a list of competitions and their corresponding results. It iterates through each competition, determines the winning team based on the result, and updates that team's score in a dictionary. The method keeps track of the team with the highest score and ultimately returns this team as the winner.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - The method processes each competition exactly once, where `n` is the number of competitions.
- **Space Complexity:** O(k) - The space complexity is proportional to the number of unique teams, `k`, since the dictionary stores a score for each team.

### How It Works
1. **Initialization:** A dictionary named `scores` is used to store the points for each team. Two variables, `maxScore` and `winner`, are used to track the highest score and the corresponding team.
2. **Iteration Through Competitions:** The method iterates through the list of competitions:
   - For each competition, it identifies the winning team based on the result list.
   - If the winning team is not yet in the dictionary, it is added with an initial score of 0.
   - The winning team's score is then increased by 3 points.
   - If this score surpasses the current `maxScore`, `maxScore` is updated to this new value, and `winner` is updated to this team.
3. **Result:** After all competitions have been processed, the method returns the team with the highest score.

### Pros
- **Efficiency:** The method is efficient, with a linear time complexity relative to the number of competitions, making it suitable for large datasets.
- **Simplicity:** The logic is clear and easy to understand, with straightforward iteration and score tracking.

### Cons
- **Assumption on Input:** The method assumes that the results are correctly paired with the competitions and that there are no ties. It also assumes all teams participate in at least one competition.
- **Limited to Basic Scoring:** The method is designed for simple scenarios where each win is awarded 3 points. It does not handle more complex scoring systems without modification.

## Conclusion

The `TournamentWinner` method provides a robust and efficient solution to determining the winner of a tournament based on competition results. It effectively tracks scores and identifies the highest-scoring team using a dictionary to store and update scores in O(1) time per competition. This solution is well-suited for scenarios where competitions are straightforward and results are unambiguous. 

Its simplicity and efficiency make it a reliable choice for solving the tournament winner problem in a variety of applications.
