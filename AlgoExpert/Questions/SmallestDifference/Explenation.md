# AlgoExpert - Smallest Difference Solution

This code provides a solution to the "Smallest Difference" problem, where the task is to find a pair of numbers (one from each of two arrays) whose absolute difference is the smallest among all possible pairs.

## `SmallestDifference`

### Description
The `SmallestDifference` method takes two integer arrays as input and returns the pair of numbers (one from each array) that have the smallest absolute difference. The approach involves sorting both arrays and using a two-pointer technique to efficiently find the pair with the smallest difference.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n + m log m) - The time complexity is dominated by the sorting operations, where `n` is the length of `arrayOne` and `m` is the length of `arrayTwo`. After sorting, a linear pass through both arrays is performed using two pointers, which takes O(n + m) time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - The space complexity is constant since the sorting is done in place and only a few additional variables are used for tracking indices and differences.

### How It Works
1. **Sort Both Arrays:**
   - Sorting both arrays simplifies the search process by allowing us to use the two-pointer technique.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique:**
   - The method initializes two pointers, `idxOne` and `idxTwo`, starting at the beginning of `arrayOne` and `arrayTwo`, respectively.
   - It compares the current pair of elements from both arrays:
     - If `arrayOne[idxOne] < arrayTwo[idxTwo]`, the pointer `idxOne` is incremented to move toward a closer pair.
     - If `arrayTwo[idxTwo] < arrayOne[idxOne]`, the pointer `idxTwo` is incremented.
     - If the elements are equal, the smallest possible difference (0) is found, and the pair is returned immediately.
   - After each comparison, the method checks if the current difference is smaller than the smallest difference found so far. If so, the smallest difference and the corresponding pair are updated.

3. **Return the Pair:**
   - The method returns the pair of numbers that have the smallest absolute difference.

### Example Walkthrough

Given the input:
- **Array One:** `[-1, 5, 10, 20, 28, 3]`
- **Array Two:** `[26, 134, 135, 15, 17]`

**Step 1:** Sort both arrays:
- Sorted `arrayOne`: `[-1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 28]`
- Sorted `arrayTwo`: `[15, 17, 26, 134, 135]`

**Step 2:** Use the two-pointer technique:
- Start with `idxOne = 0`, `idxTwo = 0`, comparing `-1` and `15`. The difference is `16`, so increment `idxOne`.
- Compare `3` and `15`. The difference is `12`, so increment `idxOne`.
- Compare `5` and `15`. The difference is `10`, so increment `idxOne`.
- Compare `10` and `15`. The difference is `5`, so increment `idxOne`.
- Compare `20` and `15`. The difference is `5`, so increment `idxTwo`.
- Compare `20` and `17`. The difference is `3`, so increment `idxTwo`.
- Compare `20` and `26`. The difference is `6`, so increment `idxOne`.
- Compare `28` and `26`. The difference is `2`, which is the smallest difference found.

**Result:** The pair with the smallest difference is `[28, 26]`.

### Pros
- **Efficiency:** Sorting both arrays and using the two-pointer technique ensures that the algorithm is efficient and avoids unnecessary comparisons.
- **Simplified Search:** Sorting allows for a straightforward comparison process, ensuring that the method works in linear time after sorting.

### Cons
- **Requires Sorting:** Sorting the arrays adds O(n log n + m log m) time, which may not be ideal if the input arrays need to remain unsorted or if they are very large.

## Conclusion

The `SmallestDifference` method provides an efficient solution for finding the pair of numbers with the smallest absolute difference between two arrays. By sorting the arrays and using the two-pointer technique, the method achieves O(n log n + m log m) time complexity, making it suitable for large inputs. This approach is easy to understand and guarantees that the smallest difference is found in an optimal manner.
