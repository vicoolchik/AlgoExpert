# AlgoExpert - Minimum Waiting Time Solution

This code provides a solution to the "Minimum Waiting Time" problem, where the task is to calculate the minimum total waiting time for a list of queries. The waiting time for a query is the amount of time it must wait before its execution, and the goal is to minimize the sum of all waiting times by optimally ordering the queries.

## `MinimumWaitingTime`

### Description
The `MinimumWaitingTime` method calculates the minimum total waiting time for the given list of queries. The optimal approach involves sorting the queries in ascending order so that shorter queries are executed first, which minimizes the waiting time for subsequent queries.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) - The dominant factor in the time complexity is the sorting step, which takes O(n log n) time, where `n` is the number of queries.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - The method uses a constant amount of extra space, as it only requires a few integer variables for calculations.

### How It Works
1. **Sort the Queries:** The input array of queries is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that the shortest queries are handled first, which reduces the waiting time for the longer queries that follow.

2. **Calculate Waiting Time:** The method initializes a `totalWaitingTime` variable to zero. It then iterates through the sorted queries:
   - For each query, it calculates the number of queries left (`queriesLeft`) that will be waiting after the current query is executed.
   - The waiting time contributed by the current query is `duration * queriesLeft`, where `duration` is the time required for the current query.
   - This waiting time is added to the `totalWaitingTime`.

3. **Return Result:** After iterating through all the queries, the method returns the `totalWaitingTime`, which represents the minimum possible total waiting time for the list of queries.

### Example Walkthrough

Given the following list of queries: `[3, 2, 1, 2, 6]`

- **Step 1:** Sort the queries: `[1, 2, 2, 3, 6]`
- **Step 2:** Calculate waiting times:
  - Query 1 (1 unit): Waiting time = `0` (as it's the first query)
  - Query 2 (2 units): Waiting time = `1 * 4 = 4`
  - Query 3 (2 units): Waiting time = `2 * 3 = 6`
  - Query 4 (3 units): Waiting time = `2 * 2 = 6`
  - Query 5 (6 units): Waiting time = `3 * 1 = 3`
- **Step 3:** Sum of waiting times = `0 + 4 + 6 + 6 + 3 = 19`

- **Result:** The minimum total waiting time is `19`.

### Pros
- **Efficiency:** The approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n log n), making it suitable for large datasets.
- **Simplicity:** The algorithm is straightforward and easy to implement, with a clear logic that is easy to follow.

### Cons
- **Sorting Overhead:** The sorting step introduces computational overhead, which is necessary but might not be ideal for very large datasets where sorting is a bottleneck.

## Conclusion

The `MinimumWaitingTime` method provides an optimal solution for minimizing the total waiting time for a set of queries. By sorting the queries in ascending order and calculating the cumulative waiting time efficiently, this approach ensures that the waiting time is minimized, making it a solid choice for scenarios where query processing order impacts overall performance.

This solution is both efficient and easy to understand, making it applicable to a wide range of problems where minimizing waiting time is crucial.
