# AlgoExpert - Sorted Squared Array Solutions

This code provides two different solutions to the "Sorted Squared Array" problem, where the task is to take a sorted array of integers (which may include negative numbers) and return a new array of the squares of those integers, also sorted in non-decreasing order. The two methods implemented are `SortedSquaredArraySolution1` and `SortedSquaredArraySolution2`. Below is a detailed description of each approach, including their advantages and disadvantages.

## `SortedSquaredArraySolution1`

### Description
The `SortedSquaredArraySolution1` method squares each element in the input array and stores the results in a new array. After all the elements have been squared, the method sorts this new array to ensure the elements are in non-decreasing order.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) - The squaring of each element is O(n), but sorting the array requires O(n log n) time, which dominates the time complexity.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - An additional array is used to store the squared values.

### Pros
- **Simple Implementation:** This method is straightforward and easy to implement, making it a good choice for beginners.
- **Clarity:** The logic is clear, with a direct approach to squaring and then sorting.

### Cons
- **Suboptimal Performance:** The sorting step makes this approach less efficient than it could be, especially for large arrays.
- **Extra Sorting:** Sorting after squaring is unnecessary if a more efficient approach is used, as in the second solution.

## `SortedSquaredArraySolution2`

### Description
The `SortedSquaredArraySolution2` method takes advantage of the fact that the input array is already sorted. It uses a two-pointer technique, where one pointer starts at the beginning (smallest value) of the array and the other at the end (largest value). It compares the absolute values of the numbers at these pointers, squares the larger absolute value, and places it in the appropriate position in the resulting array. The pointer corresponding to the larger absolute value is then moved inward, and this process continues until the entire array is processed.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - This method only requires a single pass through the array, making it linear in time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - An additional array is used to store the squared values.

### Pros
- **Optimal Performance:** This method is highly efficient with a time complexity of O(n), making it suitable for large datasets.
- **No Extra Sorting:** The two-pointer technique ensures that the squared values are placed in the correct order without needing a separate sorting step.

### Cons
- **Complexity in Implementation:** While not overly complex, this method is slightly more involved than the first approach and may be less intuitive for some developers.
- **Edge Cases:** Requires careful handling of edge cases, such as arrays with all negative or all positive numbers.

## Conclusion

- **Best for Simplicity:** `SortedSquaredArraySolution1` is a good choice if simplicity and ease of understanding are more important than performance. It is a straightforward approach that is easy to implement but comes with a performance cost due to the sorting step.
- **Best for Performance:** `SortedSquaredArraySolution2` is the better choice when performance is crucial, especially for larger arrays. It eliminates the need for additional sorting and uses a linear-time approach to ensure the output array is sorted.

Both methods are useful in different scenarios, but for most practical purposes, `SortedSquaredArraySolution2` is the recommended approach due to its superior time complexity.
