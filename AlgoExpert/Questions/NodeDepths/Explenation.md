# AlgoExpert - Node Depths Solutions

This code provides two different solutions to the "Node Depths" problem, where the task is to calculate the sum of the depths of all nodes in a binary tree. The depth of a node is defined as the distance between the node and the root of the tree. The two methods implemented are `NodeDepths` using recursion and `NodeDepthsIterative` using an iterative approach with a stack. Below is a detailed description of each approach, including their advantages and disadvantages.

## `NodeDepths`

### Description
The `NodeDepths` method computes the sum of the depths of all nodes in the binary tree using a recursive approach. It starts from the root and recursively traverses the tree, adding the depth of each node to the total sum as it goes.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - The method visits every node in the tree exactly once, where `n` is the total number of nodes in the tree.
- **Space Complexity:** O(h) - The space complexity is primarily due to the recursion stack, which can go as deep as the height of the tree, `h`. In the worst case of a skewed tree, this could be as large as `n`.

### How It Works
1. **Initialization:** The method `NodeDepths` calls the helper method `CalculateNodeDepths` with the root node and an initial depth of 0.
   
2. **Recursive Traversal:** The `CalculateNodeDepths` method recursively traverses the tree:
   - For each node, the current depth is added to the sum.
   - The method then recursively calls itself for the left and right children of the current node, increasing the depth by 1 for each recursive call.
   - The recursion continues until all nodes are processed, with each node's depth contributing to the total sum.

3. **Return Result:** The method returns the total sum of all node depths.

### Pros
- **Clarity:** The recursive approach is straightforward and easy to understand, particularly for those familiar with tree-based problems.
- **Direct Implementation:** The method mirrors the conceptual approach of calculating node depths by summing the depth at each step.

### Cons
- **Space Usage:** The recursive approach uses additional space due to the recursion stack, which can be a concern for very deep trees.

## `NodeDepthsIterative`

### Description
The `NodeDepthsIterative` method provides an iterative solution to the problem using a stack to simulate the depth-first traversal of the tree. This method avoids the potential issue of stack overflow that can occur with deep recursion.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - The method processes each node in the tree once, ensuring linear time complexity.
- **Space Complexity:** O(h) - The space complexity is due to the stack used to simulate recursion. In the worst case, the stack could hold all nodes along the longest path from the root to a leaf, which is at most the height of the tree.

### How It Works
1. **Initialization:** The method initializes a stack that stores tuples of the current node and its corresponding depth. The root node and an initial depth of 0 are pushed onto the stack.

2. **Iterative Traversal:** The method enters a loop that continues until the stack is empty:
   - It pops the top element from the stack, which gives the current node and the depth at that node.
   - The current depth is added to the sum of depths.
   - If the current node has children, they are pushed onto the stack with their corresponding depths (depth + 1).

3. **Return Result:** The method continues until all nodes are processed, and the total sum of all node depths is returned.

### Pros
- **Avoids Recursion Limits:** This method is safer for very deep trees as it avoids the limitations of the call stack in recursion.
- **Iterative Approach:** Some developers may find the iterative approach easier to manage, especially in environments where recursion depth is limited.

### Cons
- **Complexity:** The iterative approach, while avoiding recursion issues, can be slightly more complex and less intuitive than the recursive approach.

## Conclusion

- **Best for Simplicity:** The `NodeDepths` method using recursion is generally more straightforward and easier to understand. It is ideal for most scenarios unless you are dealing with extremely deep trees.
- **Best for Large Depth Trees:** The `NodeDepthsIterative` method is preferable when working with very large or deep trees where stack overflow could be a concern. It provides a robust solution without the risks associated with deep recursion.

Both methods efficiently calculate the sum of node depths in a binary tree, with the choice between them depending on the specific needs of your application.
