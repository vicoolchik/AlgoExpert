# AlgoExpert - Majority Element Solution

This code provides a solution to the "Majority Element" problem, where the task is to find the element that appears more than half the time in a given array. The solution uses the **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**, which is an optimal algorithm for this problem.

## `MajorityElement`

### Description
The `MajorityElement` method identifies the majority element in an array. A majority element is an element that appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times in the array. The method uses a voting mechanism to find the majority element in linear time and with constant space.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - The method makes a single pass through the array, where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - The method uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the size of the array.

### How It Works
The **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm** works by maintaining a candidate for the majority element and adjusting a counter based on whether the current element matches the candidate.

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `majorityElement`: Stores the current candidate for the majority element.
   - `count`: Tracks the number of votes for the current candidate.

2. **Iterate Through the Array:**
   - For each element in the array:
     - If `count == 0`, set the current element as the new candidate for the majority element.
     - If the current element matches the candidate, increment the `count`.
     - If the current element does not match the candidate, decrement the `count`.

3. **Return the Majority Element:**
   - After processing the entire array, the remaining candidate is returned as the majority element. The algorithm guarantees that if a majority element exists, it will be found by this process.

### Example Walkthrough

Given the input:
- **Array:** `[3, 2, 3]`

**Step 1:** Initialize variables:
- `majorityElement = 0`, `count = 0`

**Step 2:** Iterate through the array:
- First element (`3`): Since `count == 0`, set `majorityElement = 3`. Increment `count = 1`.
- Second element (`2`): Does not match `majorityElement`, so decrement `count = 0`.
- Third element (`3`): Since `count == 0`, set `majorityElement = 3`. Increment `count = 1`.

**Result:** The method returns `3` as the majority element.

### Pros
- **Efficiency:** The algorithm runs in O(n) time with O(1) space, making it optimal for this problem.
- **Simplicity:** The logic is straightforward and easy to implement with minimal variables.

### Cons
- **No Validation:** The method assumes that a majority element always exists. In cases where no majority element exists, the algorithm would return the candidate that was last updated, even though it may not appear more than half the time.

### Edge Cases
- **Single Element Array:** If the array contains only one element, that element is trivially the majority element.
- **Array with No Majority Element:** If the array does not contain a majority element, the algorithm will return the most frequent element, but the assumption is that the input guarantees a majority element.

### Alternative Approaches
- **HashMap Approach:** Another approach would involve using a hash map to count the occurrences of each element and then return the element with a count greater than `n/2`. This method uses O(n) time and O(n) space but is not as efficient as the Boyer-Moore algorithm in terms of space complexity.

## Conclusion

The `MajorityElement` method provides an efficient and space-optimized solution for finding the majority element in an array using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm. By maintaining a single candidate and adjusting the count based on comparisons, the method ensures that the majority element can be found in linear time with constant space.
