# AlgoExpert - Class Photos Solution

This code provides a solution to the "Class Photos" problem, where the goal is to determine if it's possible to take a class photo such that each row of students follows a specific height order. The problem involves two groups of students, one wearing red shirts and the other blue shirts. The challenge is to arrange them in two rows such that every student in the back row is taller than the student directly in front of them in the front row.

## `ClassPhotos`

### Description
The `ClassPhotos` method checks whether a valid arrangement exists where all students in one group are taller than the corresponding students in the other group when sorted by height. The method first sorts the height lists of both groups, then checks if one group can consistently be placed in the back row while the other group stands in the front row.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) - The dominant factor in the time complexity is the sorting of the height lists, where `n` is the number of students in each group.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - The method uses a constant amount of extra space, as it only requires a few integer variables for comparison.

### How It Works
1. **Sort the Heights:** The height lists of both the red shirt group and the blue shirt group are sorted in ascending order. This makes it easier to compare corresponding students between the two groups.

2. **Determine Taller Group:** The method checks which group should be in the back row by comparing the tallest student in each group (last element of the sorted list). If the tallest student in the red group is taller, the red group is expected to be in the back row. Otherwise, the blue group should be in the back row.

3. **Validate Arrangement:** The method then iterates through the sorted lists in reverse (from the tallest to the shortest students):
   - If the taller group (determined earlier) has any student that is not taller than the corresponding student in the other group, the method returns `false`.
   - If all comparisons are valid, the method returns `true`.

### Example Walkthrough

Given the following student heights:
- **Red Shirt Heights:** `[5, 8, 1, 3, 4]`
- **Blue Shirt Heights:** `[6, 9, 2, 4, 5]`

**Step 1:** Sort the heights:
- **Sorted Red Shirt Heights:** `[1, 3, 4, 5, 8]`
- **Sorted Blue Shirt Heights:** `[2, 4, 5, 6, 9]`

**Step 2:** Determine the taller group:
- The tallest student in the blue group (`9`) is taller than the tallest student in the red group (`8`), so the blue group is expected to be in the back row.

**Step 3:** Validate the arrangement:
- Compare each student from the end of the sorted lists:
  - `9 (blue)` > `8 (red)` (valid)
  - `6 (blue)` > `5 (red)` (valid)
  - `5 (blue)` > `4 (red)` (valid)
  - `4 (blue)` > `3 (red)` (valid)
  - `2 (blue)` > `1 (red)` (valid)
  
Since all comparisons are valid, the method returns `true`.

### Pros
- **Efficiency:** The method efficiently determines the valid arrangement with a time complexity of O(n log n), making it suitable for large inputs.
- **Simplicity:** The logic is straightforward, with clear steps that are easy to follow and implement.

### Cons
- **Assumption of Strict Height Comparison:** The method assumes that no two students have the same height. If there are students of equal height, additional logic would be needed to handle such cases.

## Conclusion

The `ClassPhotos` method provides a robust and efficient solution to determine if a valid class photo arrangement is possible based on student heights. By sorting the heights and comparing them systematically, the method ensures that the conditions for a proper arrangement are met, making it a reliable solution for this type of problem.

This approach is both efficient and easy to understand, making it a good choice for scenarios where student arrangement by height is required.
