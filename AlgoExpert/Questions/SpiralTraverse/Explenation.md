# AlgoExpert - Spiral Traverse Solution

This code provides a solution to the "Spiral Traverse" problem, where the goal is to traverse a 2D array in a spiral order and return the elements in the correct sequence. The spiral traversal starts from the top-left corner of the array, proceeds right, then down, left, and finally up, and repeats this process, gradually narrowing the bounds until all elements are visited.

## `SpiralTraverse`

### Description
The `SpiralTraverse` method takes a 2D array as input and returns a list of integers representing the array's elements in spiral order. The method follows the spiral pattern by iterating over the array's rows and columns and adjusting the boundaries until all elements are visited.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - The space complexity is proportional to the number of elements in the array, as all elements are stored in the result list.
### How It Works
1. **Initialize Boundaries:**
   - Four variables are initialized to represent the current boundaries of the sub-array to be traversed:
     - `startRow`: The index of the top row.
     - `endRow`: The index of the bottom row.
     - `startCol`: The index of the left column.
     - `endCol`: The index of the right column.

2. **Traverse in Spiral Order:**
   - The method uses a `while` loop to traverse the array in a spiral order. The loop continues as long as `startRow <= endRow` and `startCol <= endCol`.
   - The four main parts of the traversal are:
     1. **Traverse Right**: From `startCol` to `endCol`, on `startRow`.
     2. **Traverse Down**: From `startRow + 1` to `endRow`, on `endCol`.
     3. **Traverse Left**: From `endCol - 1` to `startCol`, on `endRow` (only if `startRow != endRow`).
     4. **Traverse Up**: From `endRow - 1` to `startRow + 1`, on `startCol` (only if `startCol != endCol`).
   
3. **Shrink Boundaries:**
   - After each full cycle (right, down, left, up), the boundaries (`startRow`, `endRow`, `startCol`, `endCol`) are adjusted to focus on the inner part of the array.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - The result list, containing the elements in spiral order, is returned.

### Example Walkthrough

Given the input:
**Array:** [ [1, 2, 3, 4], [12, 13, 14, 5], [11, 16, 15, 6], [10, 9, 8, 7] ]

- `startRow = 0`, `endRow = 3`, `startCol = 0`, `endCol = 3`.

**Step 2:** Traverse in spiral order:
- **Traverse Right**: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- **Traverse Down**: `[5, 6, 7]`
- **Traverse Left**: `[8, 9, 10]`
- **Traverse Up**: `[11, 12]`
- Adjust boundaries: `startRow = 1`, `endRow = 2`, `startCol = 1`, `endCol = 2`.

**Step 3:** Continue traversal:
- **Traverse Right**: `[13, 14]`
- **Traverse Down**: `[15]`
- **Traverse Left**: `[16]`
- Adjust boundaries: `startRow = 2`, `endRow = 1`, `startCol = 2`, `endCol = 1`.

**Result:** The final spiral traversal order is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]`.

### Pros
- **Efficiency:** The method traverses the array in O(n) time, visiting each element exactly once.
- **Simple Logic:** The method is easy to follow with clear boundaries and traversal directions.

### Cons
- **Limited to Rectangular Arrays:** This implementation assumes the input is a rectangular 2D array. If the array is non-rectangular, additional logic would be needed to handle irregular shapes.
## Conclusion

The `SpiralTraverse` method provides a simple and efficient way to traverse a 2D array in spiral order. It leverages a boundary-based approach, making it easy to manage the traversal logic and ensure all elements are visited. This solution works well for rectangular arrays and ensures O(n) time complexity.
